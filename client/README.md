# Member App - Client

This is a minimal React client compatible with `create-react-app` tooling.

Quick start:

1. In `client` run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm start` to run the dev server. The `proxy` in `package.json` forwards `/api` calls to `http://localhost:5000`.

Use the button in the UI to call `GET /api/test` on the backend.
